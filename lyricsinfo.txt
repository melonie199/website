For this assignment I was inspired by the sample code provided and decided to stick with 
the hashmap data structure to create the word frequency list, because it is a quick and 
easy way to search, insert, and delete items. To sort the hashmap I transferred the data 
into a LinkedList, because this data structure (in comparison to ArrayList) is best for 
manipulating data. For creating this HTML webpage I used a template provided on 
www.w3schools.com. I inserted a word cloud generated by my word frequency list and 
linked the lyrics text file, as well as the word frequency text file. I would like 
to improve this webpage by figuring out a way to display the text files within the 
body of the page. 
  
Noah Cyrus is a 19 year old American pop singer. I chose this song, because I have been 
obsessed with it since the first time I heard it. I never really heard any of her songs 
before, but after hearing July I was intrigued to hear more.
